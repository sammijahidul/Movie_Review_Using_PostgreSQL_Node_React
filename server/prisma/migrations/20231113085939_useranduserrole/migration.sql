/*
  Warnings:

  - You are about to alter the column `name` on the `User` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Text` to `VarChar(255)`.
  - You are about to alter the column `email` on the `User` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Text` to `VarChar(255)`.
  - You are about to alter the column `password` on the `User` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Text` to `VarChar(255)`.
  - The `role` column on the `User` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Added the required column `updated_at` to the `User` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Made the column `name` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
  - Made the column `password` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
